# Tic-Tac-Toe (Console Version)

This is a simple **two-player console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game** written in Python. It allows two players to play alternately on the same machine using the terminal.

## 🔹 How to Play

- The game board is a 3x3 grid numbered from 0 to 8.
- Players take turns entering the number corresponding to the grid position where they want to place their marker.
- Player 1 uses **X** and Player 2 uses **O**.
- The first player to get three of their markers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
- If all spots are filled and there is no winner, the game is a draw.

## 🧠 Rules

- Input must be a number from 0 to 8.
- You cannot place a marker on an already occupied cell.
- The game ends when a player wins or all 9 turns are completed.

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Clone this repository or copy the code into a `.py` file (e.g., `tic_tac_toe.py`).
3. Run the file from the terminal:

```bash
python tic_tac_toe.py
```

4. Follow the prompts to play the game.
